Amy Climer:                                            00:00                                             Hey, Amy Climer here. Yesterday, I had the privilege to join eight other facilitators from around the US, and Australia on a Zoom call. And we had a two hour ideation session, sharing ideas of, of different activities and games and, and resources for how to make virtual meetings and trainings way better, more fun, more engaging, more interesting, more relevant. And then at the end of that, to our call, we did this quick nine-minute sharing of best ideas that we had in the moment. And I want to share with you, it was super fun.

Speaker 2:                                             00:40                                             Hey, all, we've got nine really fun, creative minded, experiential trainers on with us, and we're all gonna each in under one minute, gonna share one of our best, uh, tips for virtual engagement, virtual meetings in reverse alphabetical orders, starting with Mr. Will Wise.

Will Wise:                                             01:01                                             So, one activity that we made virtual was called the rock. And the way that you can do this virtually is type in the chat box, you could choose someone. So, I could type in and send a private message to Phil. And I say, "Phil, you're the rock." And then everybody else looks on the screen and looks at the nonverbals to figure out who got the rock. And then once we discovered who got that private message, then we start calling them out and then we all have a good laugh. I'm now switching it to Ryan.

Ryan:                                                  01:39                                             Yeah, it's me. Um, I, I think one of the things in terms of whatever it is that you're doing is not to overcomplicate it and keep it as simple as possible. I have a huge tendency to wanna make things, have some like, sort of like woo value to it. And then in the end, somebody says, well, couldn't you just do it this way? And it's so much simpler. So, I appreciate that thinking. And I would say, like, unless it's absolutely necessary to go all techy on stuff, keep it simple. Uh, I don't know who's next.

Speaker 2:                                             02:13                                             Phil?

Speaker 5:                                             02:13                                             I think it's Nate. No.

Ryan:                                                  02:13                                             Well, Nate.

Speaker 5:                                             02:13                                             Phil.

Speaker 2:                                             02:13                                             Phil.

Ryan:                                                  02:13                                             Phil.

Speaker 2:                                             02:13                                             Phil.

Speaker 5:                                             02:14                                             Oh, Phil. Make sense.

Phil:                                                  02:15                                             Uh, I, I think that advice I'd give is practice with, uh, peer group prior to doing it with others so that you can get rid of all of the things that don't work well.

Ryan:                                                  02:27                                             (laughs)

Phil:                                                  02:28                                             And I think that, like, goes with this as possibly is having someone help you in the process. Be with you and deal with all the technical stuff so that you can focus on the interaction with the people you are working with, because that's the part that gets you all flustered. Because I, I try to say something, it didn't share properly, so try to practice it and maybe have someone help you out. Nate.

Nate:                                                  02:53                                             I'm next. Um, keep it human and keep it real. So, I'm with Ryan of, we have this tech as a platform to connect which is, I'm grateful for and get out of the box, go for virtual walk and talks, that's something that operation explore that we did that has had a lot of success. And, um, maybe connecting that to an app, um, to track progress, to take pictures about where people are at, but to just have that phone conversation and ideas spark, uh, and, and movement happens.

Mark:                                                  03:28                                             I think I'm next.

Nate:                                                  03:31                                             Mark.

Mark:                                                  03:33                                             Uh, for me, the, we keep attaching the word like online and virtual to these meetings. It's just a, it's still a meeting and we still have the same issues of people turning up late or, uh, what, just not being engaged. And so for me, I take that technology of the unofficial start, you know, finding ways that right from the beginning, even before the top of the hour, having something to engage people productively, and that's the whole strategy, and there's a number of little activities that you can use. It can be a puzzle, it can b- just be a question. I know the, the webinar we hosted with Chad last week, it would say, Hey, tell us where you are in the world and what would you describe as paradise? And it was wonderful watching people's answers to that that were engaged from the moment they arrived. And you didn't have to tell people what was going on, it was on the screen. Unofficial start.

Jenny:                                                 04:23                                             Nice.

Mark:                                                  04:26                                             Lisa.

Ted:                                                   04:27                                             Next is Lisa.

lisa:                                                  04:27                                             Um, yes, Amy, I see, you have to go. Do you wanna, can I invite you to go ahead of me-

Mark:                                                  04:33                                             Oh, yeah.

lisa:                                                  04:33                                             ... so we don't see your reflection?

Mark:                                                  04:35                                             Thank you.

Amy Climer:                                            04:35                                             Sure. Thanks. Um, yeah, I got another meeting in a few minutes. So, uh, an activity that I thought I would, uh, share, we kind of talked about was, um, kind of using this space, but going analog. And one of the things in, in person it might do is like use some image cards and say, find an image that represents your definition of leadership or something like that. But instead just say, get some paper and a marker, and draw a quick sketch of your definition of leadership, or what you think of as creativity or anything you want, and then have people draw and then just like, hold it all up into the screen. And you will get very different images if you give them one minute or if you give them 15 seconds, both are really good. Could be interesting, but something to play with.

lisa:                                                  05:26                                             Okay.

Amy Climer:                                            05:26                                             Good way to get conversation going.

Nate:                                                  05:28                                             Yeah.

Mark:                                                  05:29                                             Thank you, Amy. If you need to, to race off, it's been awesome to have you here.

Amy Climer:                                            05:30                                             It's been great to be here.

lisa:                                                  05:34                                             Thanks. Um, okay. M- my piece is about self care as facilitators. I ran a, a, a trial session with my colleagues at High Five, a couple weeks ago, based on the Heath brothers' Power of Moments book. And I hit end meeting and I was like completely disoriented. I was like, all the things that I rely on for transition, like what's the vibe in the room, and what's the chatter as I'm leaving? This, I just had not considered all of that. So, I'm not sure, you know, start the meeting early, ask a f- couple folks to stick around, but just that general awareness of like, I used the word grief that day at a few colleagues, and that was not, like, that was an intentional word. It was like, whoa, I'm just sitting here. So, I think it's just awareness of how, w- what's your before and after gonna be-

Jenny:                                                 06:25                                             Mm-hmm (affirmative).

lisa:                                                  06:26                                             ... as a trainer or facilitator?

Mark:                                                  06:28                                             Hmm.

Jenny:                                                 06:28                                             Mm-hmm (affirmative).

lisa:                                                  06:29                                             Um, Jenny.

Ted:                                                   06:31                                             Jenny.

Jenny:                                                 06:32                                             journey. Yeah. So, one of the things I've found in facilitating a lot of work online recently is just how critically importmen- engagement is because it is the thing that if we don't have engagement, we can't create change, we can't create connection. We can't do anything if we don't have people's attention. So, how do we set them up for success with that? Like asking them to turn up apps and notifications, email, and all the, all the things that might be coming into your sphere. And then also, how do we engage people? And one of the best ways I've found to engage people is to help people connect. So, how do you get them to connect early? How do you get them to connect often? Having little breakouts moments, having the chat going.

Jenny:                                                 07:07                                             Normally we would subdue side talk, but in these environments, we wanna really, I think, amp it up in the chat and have that going as a way to keep people engaged, connecting, supporting, and, um, one a- one another and answering each other's thoughts and ideas. So, I would always just go for engage, engage, engage, engage, whether that's through the chat, through the polls, through a connection exercise, or an icebreaker, some movement. How do you keep people focused, alert and aware and ready for what's coming next?

Ted:                                                   07:36                                             Awesome. And to wrap us up, uh, my tip is, get, invite people out of their bubble. There's somehow this little camera and this screen traps us in this little three foot radius. And so the invitation is to get people to move. So for example, everybody, right now, if we all slide to the left and slide to the right, and slide to the left. Ryan, you can lean, you're looking good. We can lean to the right, lean to the left, right? There's something about, or, uh, put your hands up and give the person next to you a high five. Lovely. So, just doing something that breaks out, physically breaks out of this space of like cave man hunched over-

Ryan:                                                  08:21                                             (laughs).

Ted:                                                   08:22                                             ... by a Zoom call, um, is immensely re-energizing. And so if you're hosting a 60 minute meeting and you're not breaking it up with at least one or two times where you invite somebody to move out of their box, um, I think you're doing a disservice to people's brains because our brains think better when blood is flowing.

Mark:                                                  08:41                                             Hmm.

Ted:                                                   08:41                                             Hope you enjoyed these nine tips. I'm sure you're missing Amy right now. And, uh, uh, feel free to share. Cheers.

Mark:                                                  08:50                                             Thank you, Ted.

Ted:                                                   08:51                                             Okay (laughs).

Mark:                                                  08:52                                             Um, that was awesome. Sorry. [crosstalk 00:08:56].

Ryan:                                                  08:58                                             That was awesome. Yeah. I just wanted l- like laugh.

Ted:                                                   08:59                                             Yeah.

Jenny:                                                 08:59                                             A lot of good tips (laughing).

Ryan:                                                  08:59                                             Yeah, you should-

lisa:                                                  09:00                                             Yeah, yeah. Like, really, whoa. That's good (laughs).

Ted:                                                   09:05                                             Forget 50 minute webinars, we just need nine minute webinars (laughs).
